(I am so cultured right now.)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, Friday night firestorm, starts with a spark,\nFeelin' fearless, dancing right there in the dark.\nSippin' slow, keepin' the cool facade,\nThis is the moment, perfectly played and broad.\nJust let it run, forget the strain,\nBefore the night turns into a hurricane.\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen the fourth, the fifth, the sixth are gone,\nSuddenly, I don't know the dawn.\nThe room is tilting, the lights are a scream,\n(Definitely not stable!)\nI’m shouting at the DJ for a song he won't play,\nTried to climb the bar, fell in a strange way.\nMy wallet's gone, my jacket's lost,\nDon't care about the final cost.\nKissed a random stranger right on the floor,\nThen ran out the door and wanted more! (To the next adventure!)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, Friday night firestorm, burning so wild,\nFeelin' reckless, acting like a crazy child.\nGuzzling fast, losing all track of the time,\nThis is the moment, reaching the ultimate climb.\n*Stop* the spinning, forget the noise,\nMaking all the most regrettable, loud choice.\n\n[Bridge]\nStumbling down the street, shoe missing one heel, (Cinderella-style!)\nTried to ride a stranger's bicycle, how did that feel?\nI'm laughing hysterically at the moon above, (He knows! He saw everything!)\nDon't know my name, don't know who to love. (But I love this pavement!)\nBanged on the wrong apartment door, yelling a friend's name, (Open up, it's me, the chaos!)\nNo control left, it’s a chaotic, burning flame.\nPhone shattered screen, a taxi driver sighs,\nSeeing the terror reflected in my own eyes.\nWhy did I push it this extreme?\nLost the night inside a waking dream. (Need a map back to reality.)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe front door is open, I barely recall the code,\nLeft a trail of damage down the whole dark road.\nTripped over the rug, landed with a thud,\nCovered in something that might be mud.\nDragged myself along the cold, hard floor,\nDidn't even bother to close the door.\nThe world goes black, the chaos dies,\nFace-down on the mattress, with a painful surprise.\nNo memory of the final climb,\nJust escaping the clutches of space and time. (Whew, made it!)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, the night went nuclear, completely unhinged, (That's a five-star review!)\nBut the bed's right here, finally unpinched.\nClose my eyes, the throbbing slows,\n'Til the next Friday, where the next storm grows.\nGoodnight, and goodbye sanity. (See you next week!)"

Long overdue!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalk these halls again, but I own the ground I tread,\nThe trembling hands are gone, the quiet voice is dead.\nI see their stunned faces, the shock behind the lies,\nTrying to place the girl they used to paralyze.\nThey want a connection, they want to speak my name,\nBut you don't get a ticket back into my game!\nThey left the window open, I flew right through the pane,\nNow they're standing in the ashes, soaking in the rain!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut that timid girl is gone, she shed her skin tonight!\nI’m crawling from the wreckage, stepping into the light!\n\n[Chorus]\nI am not the failure!

(of my perfect face.)\nMy mascara ran, my eyeliner smudged\nStanding there dripping, feeling totally fudged (Spongejul!)\nHe looked so kind, but my nerves were on the edge\nI ordered the lobster, when I wanted the hedge-hog (kidding, but I hated it).\n\n[Chorus]\nReady for a fairytale, got my high heels on\nThe music's pumping, singing my favorite song\nBut the universe is laughing, 'cause everything's gone wrong\nStill hoping tonight will be where I belong.\n\n[Verse 3]\nOne glass of wine, two, then three went down fast (Go girl!)\nTrying to make the awkward feeling last\nTalked about my ex, my cat, and my biggest fear\nSlurred every story, whispered in his ear\n\"I just love this tie!\" I probably shouted high\nThen dropped my fork, and spilled my drink near my eye\nA bright red stain, right down my little black dress\nThis date's a failure, I truly must confess.\n\n[Bridge]\nTried to stand up straight, felt the room start to spin\nLost my balance, where do I even begin?\nHe didn't laugh, didn't roll his eyes at me\nJust smiled and said, \"It's time to set you free.\"\nHe walked me to the curb, a proper gentleman\nDialed a taxi, said, \"I'll see you again.\"\n\n[Outro]\nI tried to thank him, a clumsy, mumbled word\nFor rescuing me from the most absurd\nAnd just as I climbed in, beneath the pale street light\nHe held my face and kissed me goodnight\nSuddenly, the stained dress, the tear in my hose\nThe empty purse, the tipsy prose\nAll went away, like a bad dream in the haze\nHe kissed me goodnight, in a dizzy, perfect daze.\nYeah, he kissed me goodnight."

Maybe they knew. And I should have let it go."

The filter does the job.\nVerse one is done now. That took one minute.\nThe structure is steady. It is predictable.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe are still using. The same four chords.\nThe sequence is simple. It is universally loved.\nI change the rhythm. Just a little bit now.\nThe bass notes shift. Just to pretend.\nWe are moving forward. We are progressing.\nBut the foundation. It will not move.\n\n[Chorus]\nFour chords later. We have a song here.\nFour chords later. The structure is fixed.\nFour chords later. We are hitting the charts now.\nFour chords later. The feeling is fake.\nIt saves us time. It saves us money.\nIt maximizes streams. It is all we need.\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe boss called me. Said the deadline is tight.\nThey need the master. By lunch today now.\nI cannot change it. I cannot expand.\nThe complexity is lost. The simplicity sells.\nJust add the Auto-Tune. And layer the vocals.\nIt must sound expensive. But must be quick.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe are still using. The same four chords.\nThe sequence is simple. It is universally loved.\nI change the rhythm. Just a little bit now.\nThe bass notes shift.

No need to resist.\n\n[Chorus]\nFour chords later. We have a song here.\nFour chords later. The structure is fixed.\nFour chords later. We are hitting the charts now.\nFour chords later.

Can you feel the beat?\nThe ice is dying beneath our feet.\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nI’m coming for the heart she froze\nThrough the stinging white and the heavy snows\nShe sits upon her throne of glass\nWaiting for the years to pass\nBut she doesn't know what a spark can do\nIn a world of white and a world of blue\nI’ve melted the walls, I’ve broken the spell\nWe’re leaving now from her winter hell.\n\n[Outro]\nThe flowers wait beneath the deep\nThe summer's just been fast asleep\nLet the palace crumble, let the crown fall\nWe’re walking home, past the garden wall...\nPast the garden wall.\nHome."

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nC major and a cup of lukewarm chamomile tea\nThat’s how every writing session begins for me\nA simple melody, a tale of rain and doubt\nWhispered words that never really want to shout\nI sit here cross-legged, hair tied back tight and neat\nA folksy little stanza that’s bittersweet.\nThey call me \"sensitive\", \"a poet of the soul\"\nTrying to fit my story in a tiny, perfect hole.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut when I strum this vintage six-string, something feels astray\nMy fingers want to move a different, faster way\nI close my eyes and hear a faint, distorted roar\nA beat inside my chest that keeps demanding more.\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I thought I was a singer-songwriter, a whisper in the crowd\nBarefoot on the stage, never singing too loud.\nI thought my truth was found in quiet minor keys\nA gentle breeze, rustling through the weeping trees.\nBut there’s a hum beneath the silence, a low and steady burn…\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe coffee got cold and the chamomile is gone\nI'm hitting chords too hard, staying up until the dawn.\nThe pen won't write a ballad, it only draws a scream\nOf a high-gain amplifier, living out a dream.\nI look at the poster of my acoustic hero's face\nAnd realize that I feel utterly out of place.\nMy boots are scuffed, my shirt has a tear down the side\nThis 'gentle spirit' persona, I can no longer hide.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow I’m not strumming softly, I’m attacking the wood\nA frantic, primal rhythm, finally understood.\nI open up my throat and let the air escape\nThis quiet little song is beginning to reshape!\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I thought I was a singer-songwriter, a whisper in the crowd\nBarefoot on the stage, never singing too loud.\nI thought my truth was found in quiet minor keys\nA gentle breeze, rustling through the weeping trees.\nBUT THERE'S A HUM BENEATH THE SILENCE, A LOW AND STEADY BURN...\nIt’s time for this whole quiet, pretty chapter to turn!\n\n[Bridge]\nNo more apologies, no more holding back the sound!\nI'm plugging in the cable right into the ground!\nThe feedback is singing! The drum kit is a fight!\nThis isn't a poem, this is pure electric light!\nThe leather jacket's on, the eyeliner is thick!\nThis is my real skin, this is my final trick!\n\n[Outro Chorus]\nForget the tea! Forget the rain!\nIt was always gasoline running through my veins!\nI’m not a whisper, I’m a SHOUT!\nLet the speakers blow, let the power run out!\n\n[Final Chorus/Outro]\nI AM A ROCK GIRL! HEAR THE RHYTHM, FEEL THE FIRE!\nA THOUSAND WATTS HIGHER!\nI AM A ROCK GIRL! PLUGGED IN AND UNDONE!\nMY TRUE SONG HAS BEGUN!"

Whoo!\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe weight is lifted, the syllabus torn\nThis is the very first day that we're truly born\nI feel the sunlight cutting through the old haze\nTrading in the textbooks for the open road days\nNo more formulas, no more required reading\nJust a wild heartbeat, and a life worth leading\nThe air is different, it tastes like sweet release\nA ticket to anywhere, a brand new lease!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe stood at the junction, felt the pressure and the heat\nNow the engine's running, tapping out a brand new beat\nThe rearview mirror shows the history gone\n'Cause the next great story is the one we're standing upon!\n\n[Chorus]\nOH, THE HORIZON LINE HIGH! Yeah, we're climbing the view!\nGot that electric fire in everything we do!\nLeave the past behind, chasing down the gold rush\nThe future is calling, and it's worth the rush!\nEvery single star is lining up for me\nThis is the sound of pure possibility!\n\n[Verse 2]\nUsed to dream in whispers, hiding under the desk\nNow we're shouting the plans, putting joy to the test\nThe world is a canvas, and we're holding the brush\nPainting bright colours in the absolute hush\nOf the morning calm, before the daily race starts\nWe got the power and the fire in our hungry hearts\nForget the failures, forget the small slips\nGot big ideas rolling right off our lips!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe stood at the junction, felt the pressure and the heat\nNow the engine's running, tapping out a brand new beat\nThe rearview mirror shows the history gone\n'Cause the next great story is the one we're standing upon!\n\n[Chorus]\nOH, THE HORIZON LINE HIGH!

We're about to jump in\nNo more permission slips, no second guessing, we begin!\nGot the blueprint drawn, got the mindset tight and clean\nThis ain't a finish line, fam, it's a starting scene!\nFrom the classroom chatter to the engine's roar and hum\nWe made it through the fire, now watch the future come!\nYeah!\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nOH, THE HORIZON LINE HIGH! Yeah, we're climbing the view!\nGot that electric fire in everything we do!\nLeave the past behind, chasing down the gold rush\nThe future is calling, and it's worth the rush!\nEvery single star is lining up for me\nThis is the sound of pure possibility!\n\n[Outro]\nPOSSIBILITY!\nFeel that good vibe!\nWe are ready!\nHorizon Line High!"
