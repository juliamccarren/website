The drum kit is a fight!\nThis isn't a poem, this is pure electric light!\nThe leather jacket's on, the eyeliner is thick!\nThis is my real skin, this is my final trick!\n\n[Outro Chorus]\nForget the tea!

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAnother Tuesday, another fight\nYou leave the door and slam it shut with all your might\nI'm standing here, my heart is pounding in my ears\nAnd for a moment, I could drown in all these years\nOf misunderstandings, of biting words we throw\nIt's just the way it's been since we were small, you know\nWe're oil and water, sun and bitter, stormy rain\nOne second it's a laugh, the next it's just a pain\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I can't stand your presence, and I love you from my heart\nIt's a twisted, tangled mess right from the very start\nWe push and pull, we break and bend, we say we're through\nBut a part of me is always and forever you\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe phone rings late, you're crying on the other end\nAnd all the anger just dissolves, my oldest friend\nI'm in my car before I even think it through\nThere's no one else on earth I'd rather rush to, but you\nWe sit in silence on the sofa for a while\nAnd all it takes is just a little, broken smile\nFor all the hurt to fade, like footprints in the sand\nWe don't need words to finally understand\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I can't stand your presence, and I love you from my heart\nIt's a twisted, tangled mess right from the very start\nWe push and pull, we break and bend, we say we're through\nBut a part of me is always and forever you\n\n[Bridge]\nThey say we're mirrors of each other's darkest sides\nThe one who knows exactly where the other hides\nThe secrets and the fears we'd never tell a soul\nYou're half of me that makes the other half feel whole\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I can't stand your presence, and I love you from my heart\nIt's a twisted, tangled mess right from the very start\nWe push and pull, we break and bend, we say we're through\nBut a part of me is always and forever you!\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, a part of me is always and forever you\nThrough every fight and every single thing we do\nThe one I love, the one I sometimes can't stand\nThe girl who'll always be the sister of my hand."
