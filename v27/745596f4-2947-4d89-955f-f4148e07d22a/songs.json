    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou walked in with a map in your hand\nBut you burned it down right where we stand\nI asked for water, you brought me gasoline\nThe worst unintentional arsonist I’ve ever seen\nYou say you’re helping, you say you try\nBut every \"favor\" is just a lie\nYou put the key in the wrong lock every single time\nAnd call my patience the only crime.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI’m biting my tongue ‘til it tastes like rust\nChoking on the ashes of your broken trust\nThe pressure is rising, the gauge is in the red\nThere are no words left in my head.\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I scream!\nIt’s the only way to let the poison out\nA hollow, jagged, desperate shout\nI scream!\nWhen you miss the mark by a thousand miles\nAnd cover up the wreckage with your plastic smiles\nI don't explain, I don't debate\nI just open up the gate\nAnd scream.\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou painted the windows black to see the sun\nYou broke the race before we had the chance to run\nI asked for space, you built a wall\nI asked for a lift, you made me fall\nIt’s almost impressive how you get it wrong\nLike you’ve been practicing the chaos all along\nRight intentions, wrong design\nYou’re crossing every single line.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe silence isn't working, it’s getting too loud\nI’m suffocating in your helpful cloud\nThe pressure is rising, the glass is gonna break\nHow much more of this can I take?\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I scream!\nIt’s the only way to let the poison out\nA hollow, jagged, desperate shout\nI scream!\nWhen you miss the mark by a thousand miles\nAnd cover up the wreckage with your plastic smiles\nI don't explain, I don't debate\nI just open up the gate\nAnd scream.\n\n[Bridge]\nIt’s not a word.\nIt’s not a cry.\nIt’s the sound of my sanity saying goodbye.\nYou push the button.\nI allow the blast.\nThis friendship is shattering, fading fast.\n\nDo it wrong.\nDo it wrong.\nDo it wrong again!\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Final Chorus]\nSo I scream!\nTearing through the throat, tearing through the doubt\nA hollow, jagged, desperate shout\nI scream!\n‘Cause you missed the mark by a million miles\nI’m done with the apologies and plastic smiles\nI won't explain, it's far too late\nI just open up the gate\nAnd SCREAM!\n\n[Outro]\nJust let it out.\nYeah, you get it wrong.\nSo I scream."

Can you feel the sting?\nWe’re the only living hearts in this frozen ring!\n\n[Chorus]\nSo let the blizzard break, let the engine roar\nWe’re dancing in the whiteout till we can’t feel anymore!\nBoot prints in the powder, static in the veins\nCutting through the winter like a ghost-light through the rain\nGravity is optional, the ice is just a floor\nWe’re dancing in the snow and crying out for more!\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe streetlights flick and stutter, casting shadows long and lean\nWe’re moving like a riot in a cinematic scene\nYour jacket’s dusted over, my lungs are burning cold\nBut this is how it feels to have a heart of solid gold\nForget the thermostat, forget the world inside\nWe’ve got the North Wind humming, and we’re coming for the ride.\n\n[Chorus]\nSo let the blizzard break, let the engine roar\nWe’re dancing in the whiteout till we can’t feel anymore!\nBoot prints in the powder, static in the veins\nCutting through the winter like a ghost-light through the rain\nGravity is optional, the ice is just a floor\nWe’re dancing in the snow and crying out for more!\n\n[Bridge]\nWhiteout... blackout...\nEverything is spinning in a frozen carousel\nFire in the marrow, ringing like a bell\nWe aren't melting down, we’re freezing into place\nA snapshot of the madness with the powder on your face!\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nSo let the blizzard break, let the engine roar\nWe’re dancing in the whiteout till we can’t feel anymore!\nBoot prints in the powder, static in the veins\nCutting through the winter like a ghost-light through the rain\nGravity is optional, the ice is just a floor\nWe’re dancing in the snow and crying out for more!\n\n[Outro]\nJust a blur of white...\nUnderneath the light...\nDon't let the fire die."

(I am so cultured right now.)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, Friday night firestorm, starts with a spark,\nFeelin' fearless, dancing right there in the dark.\nSippin' slow, keepin' the cool facade,\nThis is the moment, perfectly played and broad.\nJust let it run, forget the strain,\nBefore the night turns into a hurricane.\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen the fourth, the fifth, the sixth are gone,\nSuddenly, I don't know the dawn.\nThe room is tilting, the lights are a scream,\n(Definitely not stable!)\nI’m shouting at the DJ for a song he won't play,\nTried to climb the bar, fell in a strange way.\nMy wallet's gone, my jacket's lost,\nDon't care about the final cost.\nKissed a random stranger right on the floor,\nThen ran out the door and wanted more! (To the next adventure!)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, Friday night firestorm, burning so wild,\nFeelin' reckless, acting like a crazy child.\nGuzzling fast, losing all track of the time,\nThis is the moment, reaching the ultimate climb.\n*Stop* the spinning, forget the noise,\nMaking all the most regrettable, loud choice.\n\n[Bridge]\nStumbling down the street, shoe missing one heel, (Cinderella-style!)\nTried to ride a stranger's bicycle, how did that feel?\nI'm laughing hysterically at the moon above, (He knows! He saw everything!)\nDon't know my name, don't know who to love. (But I love this pavement!)\nBanged on the wrong apartment door, yelling a friend's name, (Open up, it's me, the chaos!)\nNo control left, it’s a chaotic, burning flame.\nPhone shattered screen, a taxi driver sighs,\nSeeing the terror reflected in my own eyes.\nWhy did I push it this extreme?\nLost the night inside a waking dream. (Need a map back to reality.)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe front door is open, I barely recall the code,\nLeft a trail of damage down the whole dark road.\nTripped over the rug, landed with a thud,\nCovered in something that might be mud.\nDragged myself along the cold, hard floor,\nDidn't even bother to close the door.\nThe world goes black, the chaos dies,\nFace-down on the mattress, with a painful surprise.\nNo memory of the final climb,\nJust escaping the clutches of space and time. (Whew, made it!)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, the night went nuclear, completely unhinged, (That's a five-star review!)\nBut the bed's right here, finally unpinched.\nClose my eyes, the throbbing slows,\n'Til the next Friday, where the next storm grows.\nGoodnight, and goodbye sanity. (See you next week!)"

I am the fire!\nThey tried to drown my soul, but they only fueled the pyre!\nLook at the mirror now, yeah, look at what you made!\nA steel-winged swan rising from the lonely shade!\nThe clock is ticking, hear the rhythm of the drum!\nI remember you, your judgement day has come!\nPackback! Is the promise! Long overdue!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalk these halls again, but I own the ground I tread,\nThe trembling hands are gone, the quiet voice is dead.\nI see their stunned faces, the shock behind the lies,\nTrying to place the girl they used to paralyze.\nThey want a connection, they want to speak my name,\nBut you don't get a ticket back into my game!\nThey left the window open, I flew right through the pane,\nNow they're standing in the ashes, soaking in the rain!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut that timid girl is gone, she shed her skin tonight!\nI’m crawling from the wreckage, stepping into the light!\n\n[Chorus]\nI am not the failure!

(Oh no!)\n\n[Chorus]\nReady for a fairytale, got my high heels on\nThe music's pumping, singing my favorite song\nBut the universe is laughing, 'cause everything's gone wrong\nStill hoping tonight will be where I belong.\n\n[Verse 2]\nStepped out the cab, *rip*, I heard the sound (Damn!)\nMy stocking tore, a jagged hole was found\nThen the sky opened, a torrential, sudden rain (What!)\nSoaking my dress, and washing away the pain... (of my perfect face.)\nMy mascara ran, my eyeliner smudged\nStanding there dripping, feeling totally fudged (Spongejul!)\nHe looked so kind, but my nerves were on the edge\nI ordered the lobster, when I wanted the hedge-hog (kidding, but I hated it).\n\n[Chorus]\nReady for a fairytale, got my high heels on\nThe music's pumping, singing my favorite song\nBut the universe is laughing, 'cause everything's gone wrong\nStill hoping tonight will be where I belong.\n\n[Verse 3]\nOne glass of wine, two, then three went down fast (Go girl!)\nTrying to make the awkward feeling last\nTalked about my ex, my cat, and my biggest fear\nSlurred every story, whispered in his ear\n\"I just love this tie!\" I probably shouted high\nThen dropped my fork, and spilled my drink near my eye\nA bright red stain, right down my little black dress\nThis date's a failure, I truly must confess.\n\n[Bridge]\nTried to stand up straight, felt the room start to spin\nLost my balance, where do I even begin?\nHe didn't laugh, didn't roll his eyes at me\nJust smiled and said, \"It's time to set you free.\"\nHe walked me to the curb, a proper gentleman\nDialed a taxi, said, \"I'll see you again.\"\n\n[Outro]\nI tried to thank him, a clumsy, mumbled word\nFor rescuing me from the most absurd\nAnd just as I climbed in, beneath the pale street light\nHe held my face and kissed me goodnight\nSuddenly, the stained dress, the tear in my hose\nThe empty purse, the tipsy prose\nAll went away, like a bad dream in the haze\nHe kissed me goodnight, in a dizzy, perfect daze.\nYeah, he kissed me goodnight."

Maybe they knew. And I should have let it go."

Is she scared the real her is boring?\nThat without the polish, the conversation's outpouring\nWill simply dry up, leaving silence in her wake?\nIt’s a fragile construction, built for goodness sake.\nBut the truth is, she's addicted to the easy flow,\nThe path of least resistance where the social breezes blow.\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, she’s the master of the little white lie,\nA social lubricant beneath a bright blue sky.\nIt’s the oil for the gears of her close-knit clique,\nA flawless machine, moving quick and slick.\nShe pours out falsehoods, never grand or cruel,\nJust enough to stay relevant, just enough to be cool.\nShe calls them \"Social Spackle,\" filling in the gaps,\nAnd nobody ever sees the careful mental traps.\n\n[Outro]\n\"Oh, I wish I could stay, but I have to leave now,\"\nA perfect exit line, she gracefully bows.\nShe walks away alone, checking her phone for the time,\nLeaving a wake of flawless, unpolluted, social mime.\nThe oil keeps flowing...\nThe oil keeps flowing...\nUntil the day she trips and the truth starts showing."

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe dashboard says a hundred-thousand tracks dropped yesterday\nAnother ocean of sound, just to wash the light away\nI’m a needle in a haystack, a grain of digital sand\nJust a quiet frequency drifting through a crowded land.\nThey say the math is heavy, yeah, the odds are getting thin\nHow do you find a heartbeat in all this silicon skin?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe server’s humming steady, a cold and silver glow\nCounting up the millions of the names I’ll never know.\nBut I look at this small window, and I see a flickering light\nSomeone’s hitting 'play' in the middle of the night.\n\n[Chorus]\nThe probability is one in two-hundred-and-fifty mil\nThat you’d find my voice tonight and make the world stand still.\nI don't need a stadium, I don't need a crowded hall\nIf I’m the \"one\" for you, then I don't feel small at all.\nOut of a quarter billion souls, you’re the one who’s listening in\nAnd that’s enough of a miracle for me to start again.\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy stats are flat and static, just a line along the floor\nWhile the giants in the playlists keep on screaming out for more.\nBut there’s a comment in the corner, \"This song helped me through the day\"\nAnd suddenly the algorithms just fade into the gray.\nWhy chase a ghost of glory or a million hollow views?\nWhen I can speak to one of you and give you something you can use.\n\n[Bridge]\nOne over two-hundred-and-fifty million\nThe math says I’m invisible, a ghost inside the code\nBut music isn't data, and it isn't just a road.\nIt’s a wire through the darkness, it’s a hand across the sea\nAnd the fact that you can hear me... is enough of a legacy.\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, the probability is one in two-hundred-and-fifty mil\nThat you’d find my voice tonight and make the world stand still.\nI don't need a stadium, I don't need a crowded hall\nIf I’m the \"one\" for you, then I don't feel small at all.\n\n[Outro]\nOne in a quarter billion...\nAnd you’re right here.\nYeah, you’re right here.\nThat's plenty for me."

The drum kit is a fight!\nThis isn't a poem, this is pure electric light!\nThe leather jacket's on, the eyeliner is thick!\nThis is my real skin, this is my final trick!\n\n[Outro Chorus]\nForget the tea! Forget the rain!\nIt was always gasoline running through my veins!\nI’m not a whisper, I’m a SHOUT!\nLet the speakers blow, let the power run out!\n\n[Final Chorus/Outro]\nI AM A ROCK GIRL! HEAR THE RHYTHM, FEEL THE FIRE!\nA THOUSAND WATTS HIGHER!\nI AM A ROCK GIRL! PLUGGED IN AND UNDONE!\nMY TRUE SONG HAS BEGUN!"

We're about to jump in\nNo more permission slips, no second guessing, we begin!\nGot the blueprint drawn, got the mindset tight and clean\nThis ain't a finish line, fam, it's a starting scene!\nFrom the classroom chatter to the engine's roar and hum\nWe made it through the fire, now watch the future come!\nYeah!\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nOH, THE HORIZON LINE HIGH!

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe salt is thick on the driveway, white against the grey\nYou’re moving through the kitchen in that practiced, quiet way\nI’m watching how the pilot light flickers in the draft\nWhile you’re measuring the coffee grounds like an ancient, heavy craft.\nThe windows hum a little when the North wind hits the glass\nWe’re just huddling in the kitchen, waiting for the front to pass.\n\n[Chorus 1]\nBut it’s a dry kind of winter, the kind that cracks the skin\nAnd I can’t tell if the ice is out there, or if it’s settled in\nWe’re keeping up the furnace, we’re burning through the wood\nBut we’re shivering in a house where the insulation’s good.\nYeah, the sky is turning violet, and the roads are closing down\nBut it’s been a long December since a fire was found.\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou used to be my woodsmoke, you used to be the thaw\nNow you’re just the jagged edge of everything I saw\nWe’re sleeping ‘neath the heavy quilts, four layers deep at least\nBut there’s a miles-wide valley between the west side and the east.\nI reached out for your shoulder, just to see if you were real\nYou just tightened up the fabric, like a lock against the steel.\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nThe power lines are sagging, crying under all that weight\nIt’s funny how a little frost can decide a person's fate.\nDo we wait for April? Do we wait for things to bloom?\nOr are we just two statues in a temporary room?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYeah, it’s a cruel kind of winter, and it’s right here in the hall\nAnd the way we’re acting \"civil\" is the coldest part of all.\nWe’re checking all the gaskets, we’re taping up the seams\nBut the frost is moving inward, past the pipes and through our dreams.\nNow the driveway’s buried over, and the salt has all run out\nAnd I’ve forgotten what it’s like to live without the doubt.\n\n[Outro]\nThe plow is on the main road, I can hear the distant scrape\nBut there isn’t any shovel that can help us with this shape.\n\nJust the white noise.\nJust the white out.\nStay cold, then."
