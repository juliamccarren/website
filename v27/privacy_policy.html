    <h2>2. Hosting and Infrastructure</h2>
    
    <h3>Cloudflare</h3>
    <p>
        We use <strong>Cloudflare, Inc.</strong> (101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) for our domain. Cloudflare acts as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and security service. All requests are routed through Cloudflare's infrastructure to ensure security and speed. This is based on our legitimate interest in the secure operation of our website (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
    </p>

    <h3>Cloudflare R2 (Media Streaming)</h3>
    <p>
        For hosting and streaming media files, we use <strong>Cloudflare R2</strong>. Media content is loaded directly from Cloudflare's servers. For technical reasons, your IP address is transmitted to Cloudflare. This is based on our legitimate interest in the high-performance provision of content (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
    </p>

    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>
        This website is hosted as a static site on the servers of <strong>GitHub Inc.</strong> When you access this site, GitHub automatically collects log files, including your IP address. This is based on our legitimate interest in the secure operation of our website (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
    </p>

    <h3>Design Resources (Tailwind CSS & Lucide Icons)</h3>
    <p>
        Design resources are <strong>installed locally on our server</strong>. No connection is established to external third-party servers when loading these resources.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>This website does not use cookies for analytics or marketing purposes.</strong> Any technically necessary cookies set by Cloudflare are solely for security purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Offline Functionality (Cache Storage & Service Workers)</h3>
    <p>
        To enable offline use (e.g., airplane mode), we utilize modern browser technologies such as the <strong>Cache Storage API</strong> and <strong>Service Workers</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Selected audio files (blobs) and the application logic are transferred directly into your browser's local memory. This enables zero-latency playback and ensures that the app remains functional without an internet connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> No personal data is transferred to this cache. You maintain full sovereignty: You can clear this local storage at any time via the "Purge" button in the app or your browser settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> This storage is based on our legitimate interest in providing our content in a technically self-sufficient manner (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You have the right to access, rectification, erasure, and restriction of processing, as well as the right to data portability and objection. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
