    <h2>2. Hosting and Infrastructure</h2>
    
    <h3>Cloudflare</h3>
    <p>
        We use the services of <strong>Cloudflare, Inc.</strong> (101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) for our domain. Cloudflare acts as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and security service. All requests to our website are routed through Cloudflare's infrastructure. In this process, IP addresses are processed to ensure the security and speed of our site. This is done based on our legitimate interest in the secure operation of our website (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR). We have entered into a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with Cloudflare.
    </p>

    <h3>Cloudflare R2 (Media Streaming)</h3>
    <p>
        For hosting and streaming media files (e.g., videos or audio content), we use the storage service <strong>Cloudflare R2</strong>. When you access media content on our website, it is loaded directly from Cloudflare's servers (storage). For technical reasons, your IP address is transmitted to Cloudflare to enable the delivery of the content to your browser. This is done based on our legitimate interest in the high-performance and reliable provision of audio and video content (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
    </p>

    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>
        This website is hosted as a static site on the servers of <strong>GitHub Inc.</strong> (88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA). When you access this site, GitHub automatically collects information (log files), including your IP address, to enable the delivery of the website. This is based on our legitimate interest in a secure and efficient operation of our website (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
    </p>

    <h3>Design Resources (Tailwind CSS & Lucide Icons)</h3>
    <p>
        For the consistent presentation of the site, we use design resources (Tailwind CSS) and symbols (Lucide Icons). These are <strong>installed locally on our server</strong>. When loading these resources, no connection is established to external third-party servers, and therefore no transfer of your IP address to external CDN providers takes place.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Links to Google Drive</h2>
    <p>
        We use links on our website that point to files or folders on <strong>Google Drive</strong>. The provider of this service is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you click on such a link, you leave our website and your browser establishes a direct connection to Google's servers. Your IP address is transmitted to Google. If you are logged into your Google account at the time of the click, Google can associate this visit with your personal profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        Linking is based on our legitimate interest in providing content in a user-friendly manner (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Further information can be found in Google's privacy policy: 
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>This website does not use cookies for analytics or marketing purposes.</strong> If technically necessary cookies are set by our security provider Cloudflare, this is done to ensure the security of the website.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Collection and Security</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect any personal data through contact forms or registrations. Access to the website is processed only within the scope of the hosting log files mentioned above to ensure the stability and security of the site.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You have the right to access, rectification, erasure, and restriction of processing of your personal data, as well as the right to data portability and objection. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.
