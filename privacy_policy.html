    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>
        This website is hosted as a static page on the servers of <strong>GitHub Inc.</strong> (88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA).

    <h3>Tailwind CSS & Lucide Icons</h3>
    <p>
        To display the site, we use scripts and design resources from external networks (CDNs), specifically <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>Lucide Icons</strong> (via unpkg.com). When these resources are loaded, your IP address is transmitted to the providers' servers. This is technically necessary to display the design correctly.

    <p>
        If you click on such a link, you leave our website and your browser establishes a direct connection to Google's servers. In the process, your IP address is transmitted to Google. If you are logged into your Google account at the time of the click, Google can associate this visit with your personal profile.
